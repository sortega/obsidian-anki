# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an Obsidian plugin called "Obsidian Anki" that syncs Obsidian notes to Anki flashcards. The plugin integrates with Anki via the `yanki-connect` library and provides:

- Ribbon icon for manual sync to Anki (currently connects but doesn't sync)
- Ribbon icon for inserting flashcards with note type selection
- Command palette integration with hotkeys
- Status bar indicator showing Anki connection status (ðŸŸ¢ connected / ðŸ”´ disconnected)
- Plugin settings tab for configuration and note type cache management
- Real-time Anki connection monitoring (10-second intervals)
- Flashcard insertion modal with fuzzy search and field preview

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development with watch mode (rebuilds on changes)
- `npm run build` - Build for production with type checking
- `npm run version` - Bump version in manifest.json and package.json

## Architecture

The plugin follows hexagonal architecture principles with clean separation between business logic and technical implementation:

- **Main entry point**: `main.ts` - Contains the `ObsidianAnkiPlugin` class
- **Settings management**: Handled through `PluginSettings` interface and `ObsidianAnkiSettingTab` class
- **Anki integration**: Uses hexagonal architecture with `AnkiService` interface (port) and `YankiConnectAnkiService` adapter
- **Domain layer**: Clear separation between `Flashcard` (markdown content) and `HtmlFlashcard` (rendered HTML) types
- **Type Safety**: `AnkiNote` interface uses `htmlFields` for consistent HTML content handling
- **Content Rendering**: `MarkdownService` handles markdown-to-HTML conversion with `toHtmlFlashcard()` method
- **Build system**: esbuild configuration in `esbuild.config.mjs` bundles TypeScript to `main.js`

## Key Components

- `ObsidianAnkiPlugin` - Main plugin class that handles initialization, commands, and Anki connection
- `AnkiService` - Interface (port) defining Anki operations needed by the application
- `YankiConnectAnkiService` - Adapter implementing AnkiService using yanki-connect library
- `FlashcardInsertModal` - Modal for selecting note types and inserting flashcard blocks
- `FlashcardRenderer` - Renders `HtmlFlashcard` objects with proper styling (accepts pre-rendered HTML content)
- `MarkdownService` - Handles markdown-to-HTML conversion and provides `toHtmlFlashcard()` conversion method
- `FlashcardCodeBlockProcessor` - Instance-based processor with dependency injection for App access (non-static)
- `BlockFlashcardParser` - Parses YAML-formatted flashcard content with modular `parseDeck()` and `parseTags()` methods
- `ObsidianAnkiSettingTab` - Settings interface for plugin configuration and note type cache
- `SyncProgressModal` - Modal for vault scanning and sync progress tracking
- `SyncConfirmationModal` - Modal for reviewing and confirming sync changes
- `SampleModal` - Legacy modal component (should be removed in cleanup)

## Flashcard Format

The plugin uses YAML-formatted code blocks for flashcards:

```flashcard
NoteType: Basic
Deck: Math::Algebra
Front: Question content
Back: Answer content
Tags:
  - topic1
  - topic2
```

**Important**: Tags must be formatted as a YAML list using the dash syntax. String formats like `Tags: "topic1, topic2"` are not supported and will cause parsing errors.

## Front-matter Processing

The plugin supports YAML front-matter to set default properties for all flashcards in a file:

```yaml
---
AnkiDeck: Math::Algebra
AnkiTags:
  - course-material
  - semester-1
---
```

### Property Precedence

- **Deck Selection**: `Deck:` field > `AnkiDeck` front-matter > plugin default
- **Tag Merging**: Front-matter `AnkiTags` are combined with flashcard `Tags:` (duplicates automatically removed)

### Implementation Details

- **NoteMetadata Interface**: Defined in `flashcard.ts` with `AnkiDeck?` and `AnkiTags?` properties
- **Property Constants**: `ANKI_DECK_PROPERTY` and `ANKI_TAGS_PROPERTY` in `constants.ts`
- **Front-matter Extraction**: Both sync analysis and live preview extract metadata from file cache
- **Type Safety**: Uses `FrontMatterCache` type instead of `any` for better type checking

## Deck Management

The plugin supports comprehensive deck management:

- **Deck Field**: Optional `Deck` field specifies target Anki deck
- **Hierarchical Support**: Nested decks using `::` notation (e.g., `Languages::Spanish::Verbs`)
- **Default Fallback**: Cards without Deck field use plugin's default deck setting
- **Automatic Movement**: Cards are moved to correct deck during sync without losing review history
- **Visual Feedback**: Deck name displayed in flashcard UI when different from default
- **Multi-deck Notes**: Handles notes with cards in different decks during sync

## Settings Interface

The plugin provides an improved settings interface with:

- **Reordered Settings**: Ignored tags configuration moved to second position for better prominence
- **Enhanced UI**: Wider, non-resizable text area for ignored tags with CSS-based styling
- **Tag Filtering**: Configure tags to ignore during sync (default: `marked`, `leech`)
- **Note Type Cache**: View and manage cached Anki note types from last successful connection

## Tag Filtering

The plugin supports ignoring specific tags during sync operations to avoid unnecessary changes:

- **Ignored Tags**: Configure tags to ignore during sync in plugin settings (default: `marked`, `leech`)
- **Automatic Filtering**: These tags are filtered out when converting Anki notes to flashcards and during tag comparison
- **No False Changes**: Cards won't be marked as "changed" just because of ignored tag differences
- **Import Support**: Ignored tags are also filtered when importing orphaned Anki cards back to Obsidian

## Flashcard Rendering

The plugin includes comprehensive flashcard rendering with improved type safety:

- **Type-Safe Rendering** - `FlashcardRenderer` accepts `HtmlFlashcard` objects with pre-rendered HTML content
- **Separation of Concerns** - `Flashcard` contains markdown content, `HtmlFlashcard` contains HTML content
- **Visual flashcard display** - Styled cards with note type headers, field content, and tags
- **Error handling** - Invalid flashcards show with red border and detailed error messages
- **Hover tooltips** - Error icons display specific parsing issues on hover
- **Markdown support** - Content converted from markdown to HTML via `MarkdownService.toHtmlFlashcard()`
- **Fallback display** - Invalid flashcards still show original YAML content for editing
- **Robust YAML parsing** - Uses js-yaml library for proper YAML syntax support
- **Advanced YAML features** - Supports multiline strings (|, >), arrays, quoted strings, and complex structures

### Obsidian Backlinks

The plugin doesn't automatically create backlinks from Anki to Obsidian. Instead, it adds special tags to synced cards that can be used to create links back to your Obsidian notes in Anki card templates.

## Current Limitations & TODOs

- No cloze deletion syntax support
- Missing media file synchronization

## Development Notes

- The plugin requires Anki to be running with AnkiConnect addon for proper functionality
- TypeScript compilation uses strict null checks and targets ES6
- Plugin manifest shows it's compatible with Obsidian 0.15.0+
- Development build includes inline source maps for debugging
- Development plan and roadmap available at PLAN.md
- Settings store note types from last successful Anki connection for offline use
- Button states update based on active editor and available note types

## Testing

- Ensure Anki is running with AnkiConnect addon before testing
- Use `npm run dev` for live development with automatic rebuilds
- Test both connected and disconnected states
- Verify note types are cached properly in settings

## Next Development Priorities

1. Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
2. Add cloze deletion syntax support
3. Implement media file synchronization
4. Add bulk operations for flashcard management
5. Improve error handling and user feedback

## Development Guidelines

- Don't commit changes to git unless being told
- Use CSS classes instead of inline styles for UI components
- Maintain type safety with separate `Flashcard` (markdown) and `HtmlFlashcard` (HTML) interfaces
- Place content conversion logic in `MarkdownService` for consistency
