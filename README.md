## Usage

### Creating Flashcards

Use the flashcard insertion button in the ribbon or create flashcard blocks manually:

```flashcard
NoteType: Basic
Front: What is the capital of France?
Back: Paris
Tags:
  - geography
  - europe
```

**Important**: Tags must be formatted as a YAML list using the dash syntax shown above. String formats like `Tags: "geography, europe"` are not supported.

### Advanced Flashcard Formatting

The plugin supports rich markdown content within flashcards:

#### Multi-line format with Markdown
```flashcard
NoteType: Basic
Front: |
  What is the **Pythagorean theorem**?
  
  ![triangle](triangle.png)
Back: |
  The formula is: `a¬≤ + b¬≤ = c¬≤`
  
  Where:
  - a and b are the legs
  - c is the hypotenuse
Tags:
  - math
  - geometry
```

### Supported Note Types
The plugin automatically detects your Anki note types and their fields. Common formats include:
- **Basic**: Front, Back
- **Basic (and reversed card)**: Front, Back
- **Cloze**: Text
- **Custom note types**: Any fields you've defined

### Syncing to Anki
Click the sync button in the ribbon to synchronize your flashcards with Anki. The plugin will:
1. Scan your vault for flashcard blocks
2. Compare with existing Anki cards
3. Show you what changes will be made
4. Apply changes after confirmation
5. Update Obsidian files with new Anki IDs

### Obsidian Backlinks

The plugin doesn't automatically create backlinks from Anki to Obsidian. Instead, it provides a way to link back to 
your Obsidian notes:
1. **Add special fields**: Include `ObsidianVault` and `ObsidianNote` fields in your Anki note types
2. **Auto-population**: Fields are automatically filled during sync with vault name and file path
3. **Create links**: Add `obsidian://open?vault={{ObsidianVault}}&file={{ObsidianNote}}` to your Anki card templates
4. **Click to open**: Click the link in Anki to jump directly to the source note in Obsidian

## Configuration

Access plugin settings through Settings ‚Üí Plugin Options ‚Üí Obsidian Anki:
- View cached note types from your last Anki connection
- Reset note type cache if needed
- Configure ignored tags (default: marked, leech) to exclude during sync
